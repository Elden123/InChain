# InChain
Blockchain for medical history.

## Inspiration
While thinking about the prompt, we realized the untapped potential a comprehensive medical database would offer. With more data on medical issues, far better algorithms could be developed for things such as predicting sports injuries, and assessing insurance prices.

## What it does
inChain allows doctors to enter information on their patients' ailments and injuries. This data is stored in a blockchain to preserve the integrity of the data. Unlike existing medical databases, inChain offers better security and is centralized across all medical institutions.

## How we built it
We first built a web server using Google Cloud Compute Engine with python. Next we built a blockchain. We also used Twilio in order to send the patient SMS messages from the doctor regarding recent medical issues. 

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time working with blockchain, as a result, our team spent lots of time trying to get the blockchain to work in conjunction with our server. We also struggled with firewalls when building our server.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had a working http server and a blockchain even though none of us had any previous experience with blockchain technology.

## What we learned
Our team learned a substantial amount about blockchain technology as well as the different rules associated with firewalls when building servers.

## What's next for inChain
In the future, we see inChain directly connecting athletes and patients with their doctors to verify their medical issues in order to create a more secure and convenient medical database.
